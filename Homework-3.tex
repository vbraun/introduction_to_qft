\noindent Please hand in by next Thursday (November 6), either during the
lecture or email to \texttt{<Philipp.Kleinert@physics.ox.ac.uk>}.
Tutorials location: Conference Room (31. October), Seminar Room
(7. November).



\begin{enumerate}
\item Verify that the Feynman propagator is a Green's function by
  acting on it with the Klein-Gordon operator $-\partial_x^2+m^2$.
\item Let $\psi$ be a complex-valued\footnote{So far, we only used
    real-valued fields in the lecture.} field with Lagrangian density
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = -\partial_\mu \psi \partial^\mu \psi^* - |\psi|^2.
  \end{equation}
  Show that $\mathcal{L}$ is real and invariant under the symmetry
  $\psi \mapsto e^{i\theta} \psi$ for a constant $\theta\in\R$.
\item Add sources $\mathcal{L} \mapsto \mathcal{L} + J^* \psi + J
  \psi^*$ to the Lagrangian and evaluate the path integral $Z(J,
  J^*)$.
\item Compute the time-ordered two-point functions
  \begin{equation}
    \langle 0 | T \psi(x) \psi(y) |0\rangle, \quad
    \langle 0 | T \psi(x) \psi^*(y) |0\rangle, \quad
    \langle 0 | T \psi^*(x) \psi^*(y) |0\rangle.
  \end{equation}
\item Use Wick's theorem to evaluate the time ordering of the product
  of two normal ordered squares
  \begin{equation}
    T\Big(:\phi(x)^2:~\times~:\phi(y)^2:\Big).
  \end{equation}
  Show that this is finite, that is, can be written in terms of normal
  ordered products and propagators \emph{not} evaluated at zero. Hint:
  Write it as particular limit of 4 distinct points. You only need
  to apply Wick's theorem repeatedly.
\end{enumerate}
