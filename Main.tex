\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Fields}

The subject of these lectures is quantum field theory, one of the most
important tools for quantitatively describe physical processes in the
microcosmos. The fundamental objects, you might have guessed it, are
\emph{fields}. They are a function of space and time, and take values
in some set. For the most part of this introduction, we will only
consider real-valued fields
\begin{equation}
  \phi(\vec x, t) \in \R
  \quad \forall (\vec x, t) \in \R^{3,1}  
\end{equation}
What we commonly call particles are excitations of this underlying
physical field. Clearly this has the potential to explain both
particle-like and wave-like behavior, provided we can define
observables and find rules for the time evolution of states.

\subsection{Lattice Renormalization}

Let us go back to the 2-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory on the lattice.
In perturbation theory and after Wick rotation, we have the two-point
function
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \Gamma^{(2)} =&\; 
    \frac{1}{k^2+m^2} + 
    \frac{1}{(k^2+m^2)^2} 
    \left(
      -\frac{\lambda}{2} T + C
    \right)
    + O(\lambda^2)
    \\
    \frac{1}{\Gamma^{(2)}} =&\; 
    k^2 + m^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2}T - C
    + O(\lambda^2)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
  T = \int \frac{d^2p}{(2\pi)^2} 
  \frac{1}{p^2+m^2}
\end{equation}
is the divergent tadpole integral and $C$ is a counterterm which
cancels the divergence. On the lattice every quantity is a sum over
the finitely many lattice points, so is necessarily finite. However,
in the continuum limit we have to reproduce the divergence. In
renormalization terms, the lattice discretion acts as a regularization
just like dimensional regularization. The lattice regularized version of the
divergent integral $T$ is
\begin{equation}
  T_L = \frac{1}{N^2}
  \sum_{p_L^2} \frac{1}{p_L^2 + m_L^2}
\end{equation}
where $p_L$ are the lattice momenta and $N$ is the number of lattice
points in each of the 2 directions. Also, recall the dimensionless
lattice parameters (in 2d) are
\begin{equation}
  m^2_L = m^2 a^2
  ,\quad
  \lambda_L = \lambda^2 a^2
  .
\end{equation}
By definition, the $p_L^2$ are the eigenvalues of the lattice
Laplacian $\Delta_L$, that is, the discretized Laplacian.

\subsubsection{Lattice Laplacian in 1D}

In one dimension we can think of the discretized function as a vector
with $N$ entries. The Laplacian, with periodic boundary conditions, is
then the matrix
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_L = 
  \left(
    \begin{smallmatrix}
      2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -1 \\
      -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 2 & -1 \\
      -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & -1 & 2
    \end{smallmatrix}
  \right).
\end{equation}
The zero mode is the constant vector $\phi_0 = (1, \dots, 1)$ and the
highest frequency mode is the alternating vector $\phi_4 = (1, -1, 1,
-1, \dots, -1)$ whose eigenvector is $4$. Hence there are $N$
eigenvalues in the range $p_j^2 \in [0,4]$. A computation yields
\begin{equation}
  p_j^2 = 4 \sin^2\left(\tfrac{\pi j}{N}\right)
  ,\quad
  j \in \{0, \dots, N-1\}.
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Lattice Laplacian in 2D}

The 2-dimensional eigenfunctions on the $N\times N$ square lattice are
\begin{equation}
  \phi_{ij}(x,y) = \phi_i(x) \phi_j(y)
\end{equation}
so there are $N^2$ eigenvalues
\begin{equation}
  p^2_{i} = 
  4 \sin\left(\tfrac{\pi i}{N}\right) + 
  4 \sin\left(\tfrac{\pi j}{N}\right)
  ,\quad
  i, j \in \{0, \dots, N-1\}.
\end{equation}
Hence, the lattice approximation to the divergent tadpole integral is
\begin{equation}
  T_L = \frac{1}{N^2}
  \sum_{i,j = 0}^{N-1}
  \frac{1}{
    m_L^2 + 
    4 \sin\left(\tfrac{\pi i}{N}\right) + 
    4 \sin\left(\tfrac{\pi j}{N}\right)
  }
\end{equation}
A bit of complex analysis shows that the large volume limit $N\to
\infty$ exists. With some more work one can show that
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{N\to \infty} T_L = 
  \int_0^\infty e^{-m_L^2 t}
  \left(
    e^{-2t} I_0(2t)
  \right)^2 = 
  \frac{2}{(4+m_L^2)\pi} 
  K\big(\tfrac{4}{4+m_L^2}\big)
\end{equation}
where $I_0$ is the Bessel function and $K$ is the elliptic integral of
the first kind. In the lattice literature you can usually find only
the semidefinite integral, though it is not as convenient as the
closed form for actually evaluating $T_L$. Also, note that we haven't
done the continuum limit $a\to 0$ yet. In that limit, $m_L^2 = m^2 a^2
\to 0$ which diverges because $K$ has a simple pole at $K(1)$. This is
of course necessary to reproduce the divergence in the field
theory. In other words, this is the lattice analog to the divergence
of $T$ in the dimension $d\to 2$ limit in dimensional regularization.


\subsubsection{Renormalization Prescription}

To renormalize the lattice values we need to pick a suitable
renormalization prescription. We also want it to satisfy two physical
requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The renormalization prescription should distinguish the two
  phases, because that is what we are interested in. But just looking
  at the $1/\Gamma^{(2)}$ limit as $k\to 0$ does not, in the zero
  momentum limit the field just sits around the minimum. Both the
  symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking mimimum look locally the
  same, so our renormalization prescription should include non-zero
  momenta.
\item The renormalization prescription should be convenient for
  lattice calculations.
\end{enumerate}
THe solution to both of these requirements is to take $T_L$ as the
counterterm,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2dphi4bare}
  \begin{split}
    m^2_{L, \text{bare}} =&\; m_L^2 - \frac{\lambda_L}{2} T_L(m^2_L)
    \\ 
    \lambda_{L, \text{bare}} =&\; \lambda_L
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
In the lattice simulation, we necessarily picked \emph{bare} values
for the parameters by hand. Also, note that the lattice code used
$\frac{1}{4}\lambda \phi^4$ instead of $\frac{1}{4!}\lambda \phi^4$ as
interaction term, this leads to extra factors of $6$ below. Using the
$\frac{}{4!}$ convention, the transition line was numerically around
\begin{equation}
  m^2_{L,\text{bare}} \approx -1.27
  ,\quad
  \lambda_{L, \text{bare}} \approx 6.0.
\end{equation}
To get the physical parameters, we have to numerically invert
eq.~\eqref{eq:2dphi4bare}, which yields
\begin{equation}
  m_L^2 \approx 0.0980
  ,\quad
  \lambda_L \approx 6.0
  .
\end{equation}
We now take the continuum limit while staying on the transition
line. In the $m_L^2$ vs.\ $\lambda_L$ plane, the transition is almost
on a line. The physically interesting values is the slope at the
origin, which defines the \emph{critical value}
\begin{equation}
  f = \lim_{a=0} 
  \frac{\lambda_L}{6 m^2_L}
  \approx
  10.8
\end{equation}
